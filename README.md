# Block9
This is LSF's brief bio on a website.
This is my second attempt of working with branches and repositories on my website build. I made some errors in order of commands on pushing files and came to a decision to make a new repository, rework some of my files on the local machine and once fully satisfied start the github process over and create a directory to the updated website. I am using AI to make sure I follow all the steps correctly this time.
I have created a HOME About and Portfolio page with audio and added images. 
I used barely any javascript as I am still very unfamiliar with the language.
